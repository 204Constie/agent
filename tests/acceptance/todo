- Add better error messaging (same as in godzilla), raise_for_status is useless
- Add logging


ISSUES AND QUESTION:

--------- v1/activate
1. Multiple query parameters parameters together. How's that handled?
- for example in activate call: experimentKkey, featureKey, type, enabled together?

2. enabled parameter:
NOT WORKING - I GET BACK BOTH DECISIONS FOR FEATURES AND EXPERIMENTS, REGARDLESS IF THEY ARE ENABLED OR DISABLED!!!
SHOULD FILTER PER "enabled" field.

3. How to test disableTracking??
- Setting to true should disable impression tracking for ab experiments and feature tests.
But how do I test this, do I need track inside activate and set disableTracking to true and see if track doesn't send event - no 204 code?

- track should not send the event when disableTracking is True. BUT IT SENDS (response is 204) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - see test_activate__disableTracking


---------- v1/track
1. If I add experimentKey as param next to eventKey in track call, what happens to experimentKey, because there's no server logs. Get's ignored?
params = {
        "experimentKey": experiment_key,
        "eventKey": "myevent",
    }


2. BUG! - non-existing event resturns 204 instead of 404!!
